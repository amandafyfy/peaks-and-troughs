* All code is run through [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) as a pre-commit hook to ensure that Python code is of a consistent stlye
* [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used as a pre-commit hook as well to test that the types of variables are as expected
* The most outer html tags within the content blocks are ```<section>``` to ensure that it is clear where each component starts and ends
