What is Bonds?(Cited from: https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/education/how-to-invest-in-bonds#:~:text=Bonds%20%E2%80%93%20also%20known%20as%20fixed,a%20certain%20period%20of%20time.)
- Bonds are a type of fixed income investments.
- Bonds are used by governments or companies to raise money by borrowing from investors. Bonds are typically issued to raise funds for specific projects. In return, the bond issuer promises to pay back the investment, with interest, over a certain period of time.
- Bonds can play a vital role in any investment portfolio. Bonds yield income, are often considered less risky than stocks and can help diversify your portfolio.

3 types of bonds:
- Corporate bonds are debt instruments issued by a company to raise capital for initiatives like expansion, research and development. The interest you earn from corporate bonds is taxable. But corporate bonds usually offer higher yields than government or municipal bonds to offset this disadvantage.
- Municipal bonds are issued by a city, town or state to raise money for public projects such as schools, roads and hospitals. Unlike corporate bonds, the interest you earn from municipal bonds is tax-free. There are two types of municipal bonds: general obligation and revenue.
    - Municipalities use general obligation bonds to fund projects that don't produce income, such as playgrounds and parks. Because general obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing municipality, the issuer can take whatever measures necessary to guarantee payments on the bonds, such as raising taxes.
    - Revenue bonds, on the other hand, pay back investors with the income they're expected to create. For example, if a state issues revenue bonds to finance a new highway, it would use the funds generated by tolls to pay bondholders. Both general obligation and revenue bonds are exempt from federal taxes, and local municipal bonds are often exempt from state and local taxes as well. Revenue bonds a good way to invest in a community while generating interest.
- Treasury bonds (also known as T-bonds) are issued by the U.S. government. Since they’re backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, treasury bonds are considered risk-free. But treasury bonds don’t yield interest rates as high as corporate bonds. While treasury bonds are subject to federal tax, they’re exempt from state and local taxes.

Tips of investing in bonds:
- Know when bonds mature.
    The maturity date is the date when your investment will be repaid to you. Before you commit your funds, know how long your investment will be tied up in the bond.
- Know the bond’s rating.
    A bond’s rating is an indication of how creditworthy it is. The lower the rating, the more risk there is that the bond will default – and you lose your investment. AAA is the highest rating (using the Standard & Poor’s rating system). Any bond with a rating of C or below is considered a low quality or junk bond and has the highest risk of default.
- Investigate the bond issuer’s track record.
    Knowing the background of a company can be helpful when deciding whether to invest in their bonds.
- Understand your tolerance for risk.
    Bonds with a lower credit rating typically offer a higher yield to compensate for higher levels of risk. Think carefully about your risk tolerance and avoid investing solely based on yield.
- Factor in macroeconomic risks.
    When interest rates rise, bonds lose value. Interest rate risk is the risk that rates will change before the bond reaches its maturity date. However, avoid trying to time the market; it’s difficult to predict how interest rates will move. Instead, focus on your long-term investment objectives. Rising inflation also poses risks for bonds.
- Support your broader investment objectives.
    Bonds should help diversify your portfolio and counterbalance your investment in stocks and other asset classes. To make sure your portfolio is balanced appropriately, you may want to consult an asset allocation calculator based on age.
- Read the prospectus carefully.
    If you’re investing in a bond fund, be sure to study the fees and analyze exactly what types of bonds are in the fund. The name of the fund may only tell part of the story; for example, sometimes government bond funds also include non-government bonds.
- Use a broker who specializes in bonds.
