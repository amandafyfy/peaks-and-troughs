Derivatives are securities whose value relies upon the value of another asset, whether a single asset or a group. This means that the price of the derivative changes as the price of the underlying asset fluctuates. Common underlying assets for derivatives are stocks, bonds, commodities, interest rates, and market indexes. A derivative can essentially be seen as a gamble on the underlying asset, without directly having exposure to said asset.

Derivatives were a major contributor to the 2008 financial crisis due to their largely unregulated nature, as they are traded between two parties, and there is a risk that the one side of the traded might default. Mortgage-backed securities are a good example of where investors bet on the stability of the housing market, with the underlying security being home loan mortgages. Another contributor to the financial crisis were banks selling derivatives where the underlying asset were other derivatives.

Derivatives have many legitimate uses apart from crashing the financial markets. They are often used to hedge positions, that is, if I have exposure if an asset price goes up, I buy a derivative to bet the asset price goes down so I minimise my risk exposure to that asset. This is common for currencies, where international companies that do business across the globe in local currencies use derivatives to hedge their risk that the local currency changes.

Common types of derivatives are futures (buying and receiving an asset in the future), forwards (similar to futures but only traded between people not on an exchange), swaps (exchange one type of cash flow for another), and options (an agreement to potentially buy an asset in the future).
