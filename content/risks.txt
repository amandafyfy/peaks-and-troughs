Any convsersation about the risks of investing has to start with Bernie Madoff, who ran the largest
Ponzi scheme ever. He took money from investors and then simply left it in the bank and used it to
fund his lavish lifestyle whilst telling them they were getting decent returns. When those
investors wanted their profits, he used the money from other investors to pay them out, and so on,
and so on. He was brought down when the market fell in 2008 and too many people wanted their money.
