Any conversation about the risks of investing has to start with Bernie Madoff, who ran the largest Ponzi scheme ever. He took money from investors and then simply left it in the bank and used it to fund his lavish lifestyle whilst telling them they were getting decent returns. When those investors wanted their profits, he used the money from other investors to pay them out, and so on, and so on. He was brought down when the market fell in 2008 and too many people wanted their money.

There are a range of other investment risks. Market risk is where the value of the entire market decreases. This can be due to economic developments such as a recession or environmental factors such as natural disasters. Liquidity risk is where you cannot cash out your investment when you want, leading to greater exposure than you intend. This is often seen in more illiquid investments such as real estate.

Concentration risk is where you put too many of your eggs in one basket. This is common for new investors who don't have the amount of capital to invest that can be spread across many different investments, and are forced to start with just one basket. Inflation risk is where the cost of living is increasing faster than your investments. This often happens by just leaving money in the bank as savings.

There are many other risks that may impact your decision to invest or not invest. The best way to avoid these risks is to do your research, understand the investment and the risk it poses, and find something that you are comfortable taking on, knowing the downside. Plus if something seems to good to be true, it probably is.
