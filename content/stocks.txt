A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares."

People aim to make money from investing in shares through one or both of an increase in share price and a share in the company's benefit.

There are 2 main types of stocks: common and preferred. Common stock allows the owner to vote at stakeholder meetings and receive dividend from the company. Preferred stakeholders do not have voting right, though they have a higher claim on assets and earnings than the common stockholders when a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated.

Capital gain means that making money by buying the share in one price and sell it with a higher price. However, if the selling price is lower than the buying price, you're lossing money. Dividends are a portion of company profits paid out to shareholders, usually twice a year. Companies donâ€™t have to pay dividends, but many see it as a way of returning earnings to their shareholders.
