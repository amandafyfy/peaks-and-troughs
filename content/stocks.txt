Stocks, or equities, are a type of security that represents ownership of a company. Well, a fraction of a company, which entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the company's assets. Stocks are often referred to as shares, as the owner has a share of the ownership of the company, proportional to their number of stocks.

There are two main types of stocks, common and preferred. Common stock are, as the name suggests, the most common and what most people own. They convey an ownership of the company and allow for voting in company meetings. Preferred stock do not convey any voting rights, but if the company collapses and is liquidated, they get paid out their share of ownership before common stock is. A benefit of most companies is limited liability, that is, if a company does fail, the shareholders are not personally liable.

People invest in stocks to make money in two main ways. The first is through dividends, which are part of the profits of the company that they pay out to the owners of stocks. This is up to the company and there is no requirement to do so. The second way is through the company becoming more valuable, and the price of the stocks increasing. This leads to a profit when the stock is sold to another investor, however any profits will be subject to Capital Gains Tax if the price did increase.

Companies can continue to issue new stocks if they need to raise more money, which dilutes the ownership of all current shareholders due to the higher number of stocks on the market. As this is accompanied with an inflow of cash to the company, issuing new shares should not decrease the price of the stock.

to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares."

There are 2 main types of stocks: common and preferred. Common stock allows the owner to vote at
stakeholder meetings and receive dividend from the company. Preferred stakeholders do not have voting
right, though they have a higher claim on assets and earnings than the common stockholders when a
company goes bankrupt and is liquidated.

Capital gain means that making money by buying the share in one price and sell it with a higher price.
However, if the selling price is lower than the buying price, you're lossing money. Dividends are a
portion of company profits paid out to shareholders, usually twice a year. Companies donâ€™t have to
pay dividends, but many see it as a way of returning earnings to their shareholders.
